//Data Types

//A variable in JavaScript can contain any data. A variable can at one moment be a string and later receive a numeric value:

// no error
let message = "hello";
message = 123456;

/*Programming languages that allow such things are called “dynamically typed”, meaning that there are data types, but variables are not bound to any of them.

There are seven basic data types in JavaScript. Here we’ll study the basics, and in the next chapters we’ll talk about each of them in detail.

*/

/* Data Types:

1. A number
2. A string
3. A boolean (logical type); true/false
4. The "null" value
5. The "undefined" value
6. Objects and Symbols
7. The typeof operator
