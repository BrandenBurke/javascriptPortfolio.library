//A code editor is the place where programmers spend most of their time.
//There are two archetypes: IDE and lightweight editors. Many people feel comfortable choosing one tool of each type.
//“Lightweight editors” are not as powerful as IDEs, but they’re fast, elegant and simple.
//They are mainly used to open and edit a file instantly.
//The main difference between a “lightweight editor” and an “IDE” is that an IDE works on a project-level, so it loads much more data on start, analyzes the project structure if needed and so on. A lightweight editor is much faster if we need only one file.
